# Fix Deploy Issue - January 25, 2025

## 🚨 Problem Identified

The deployed site at seo.converso.pro was showing old content (297 resources) instead of the new organized library with 65+ articles in 6 categories.

### Root Cause:
1. **post-build.js** was overwriting the correct index.html with hardcoded old content
2. Complex build system with templates and fallbacks was not needed
3. The build process was destroying the manually created HTML pages

### Evidence:
- Local `output/index.html`: Shows "65+ guias especializados" ✅
- Deployed site: Shows "297 resources" ❌
- post-build.js: Contains hardcoded HTML with 297 resources

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Eliminated Build System
- Renamed old files to `.old` extension:
  - `build.js` → `build.js.old`
  - `pre-build.js` → `pre-build.js.old`
  - `post-build.js` → `post-build.js.old`
  - `preserve-custom-pages.js` → `preserve-custom-pages.js.old`

### 2. Created Simple Deploy System
- New file: `deploy-static.js` - Simply copies files from output/ to deploy-output/
- No templates, no fallbacks, no build process
- Just pure static HTML files

### 3. Updated Configuration
- `package.json`: Removed build scripts, added simple deploy script
- `vercel.json`: Changed outputDirectory from "output" to "deploy-output"

## 📁 New Structure

```
output/              # Working directory with all HTML files
deploy-output/       # Clean copy for deployment (created by npm run deploy)
```

## 🚀 Deployment Process

```bash
# 1. Prepare deployment
npm run deploy

# 2. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Remove build system, deploy only static HTML files"
git push origin main
```

## 📊 Verification

Deploy script confirmed:
- ✅ index.html (35420 bytes) - Contains "65+ guias"
- ✅ All 6 category pages present
- ✅ 410 total HTML files
- ✅ sitemap.xml and robots.txt included

## Expected Result

After deployment, seo.converso.pro should show:
- Homepage with "65+ guias especializados"
- 6 working category pages
- No more fallback content
- No more "297 resources"
