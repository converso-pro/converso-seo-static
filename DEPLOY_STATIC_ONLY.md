# Deploy Static Only - New Deployment System

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: NO MORE BUILD SYSTEM!

We've eliminated the complex build system that was causing fallback issues. Now we only deploy the static HTML files that are already created.

## Problem Solved

The old system had:
- `build.js` - Generated pages with fallbacks
- `post-build.js` - Overwrote index.html with old content (297 resources)
- Complex template system that wasn't needed

This caused the deployed site to show old content instead of the new 65+ organized articles.

## New Simple System

### To Deploy:

1. Make changes directly to HTML files in the `output/` directory
2. Run: `npm run deploy`
3. This copies all files to `deploy-output/` 
4. Commit and push to GitHub

### Available Commands:

```bash
# Prepare files for deployment
npm run deploy

# Test locally (output directory)
npm run serve

# Test deployment directory
npm run serve:deploy
```

## File Structure

```
output/                    # Your working directory - edit HTML files here
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html            # Main page (65+ articles)
â”œâ”€â”€ barbearias/          # Category pages
â”œâ”€â”€ assistencia-tecnica/
â”œâ”€â”€ gestao-crescimento/
â”œâ”€â”€ saloes-beleza/
â”œâ”€â”€ ecommerce/
â”œâ”€â”€ sistemas-agendamento/
â”œâ”€â”€ en/                  # English pages
â”œâ”€â”€ es/                  # Spanish pages
â”œâ”€â”€ artigos/             # Individual articles
â”œâ”€â”€ articles/
â”œâ”€â”€ articulos/
â”œâ”€â”€ sitemap.xml
â”œâ”€â”€ robots.txt
â””â”€â”€ styles.css

deploy-output/           # Clean copy for deployment (created by npm run deploy)
```

## Workflow

1. Edit HTML files directly in `output/` directory
2. Test locally: `npm run serve`
3. Prepare deployment: `npm run deploy`
4. Verify: `npm run serve:deploy`
5. Commit and push to trigger Vercel

## No More Fallbacks!

All pages are now static HTML. No JavaScript build process. No templates. No fallbacks.

## Archived Files

The old build system files have been renamed with `.old` extension:
- `build.js.old`
- `pre-build.js.old`
- `post-build.js.old`
- `preserve-custom-pages.js.old`

Do not use these files!
